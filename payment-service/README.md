# Payment Service

## Overview
The **Payment Service** is a critical component of the Event-Driven Order Management System. It handles payment processing for customer orders in a secure and scalable manner, utilizing **Spring Boot** for the service logic and **Kafka** for asynchronous messaging. This service is designed with extensibility and fault tolerance in mind.

---

## Features

- **Asynchronous Payment Processing**: Uses Kafka to handle payment events.
- **REST API**: Exposes endpoints for payment operations.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design for easy integration with other services.
- **Containerization**: Fully containerized using Docker.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated logging with Logback and health monitoring via Spring Actuator.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Kafka**
- **Docker**
- **JUnit 5** for unit testing
- **Logback** for logging

---

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17**
- **Maven 3.8+**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Kafka**
