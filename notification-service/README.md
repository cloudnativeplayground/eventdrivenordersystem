# Notification Service

The **Notification Service** is a part of the **Event-Driven Order Management System**. It is responsible for sending notifications to users based on various events, such as order creation or status updates. This service leverages **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, and a RESTful API to achieve its functionality.

---

## Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Consumes messages from Kafka topics to trigger notifications.
- **REST API**: Exposes endpoints for status checks and manual notification sending.
- **Scalable Design**: Built with Kafka for distributed and scalable event handling.
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Simplifies configuration and dependency management.
- **Logging**: Configured with Logback for structured and meaningful logs.

- **Maven**
- **Docker (Optional)**
